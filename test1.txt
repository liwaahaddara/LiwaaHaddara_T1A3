This is a walkthrough of a demonstration of one of the features in the Library program:

* The feature we'll be testing will be navigation of the main menu

* Immediately after running our bash script in the terminal, we'll be presented with
a welcome screen and the program's options that are available to the user (a total of 6, each reprsented by an integer from 1 to 6)
