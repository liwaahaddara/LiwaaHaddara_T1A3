This is a walkthrough of a demonstration of one of the features in the Library program:

* The feature we'll be testing will be navigation of the main menu

* Immediately after running our bash script in the terminal, we'll be presented with
a welcome screen and the program's options that are available to the user (a total of 6, each reprsented by an integer from 1 to 6)



TEST CASE NUMBER ONE:
* Done on Sunday 17th July, 2022 around 7:05PM
* Entering the number "1" when in the main menu should print out the current catalogue of books, with each displaying the title and author names on the terminal.

* Test Result: SUCCESSFUL


TEST CASE NUMBER TWO:
* Done on Sunday 17th July, 2022 around 7:10PM
* Entering the number "6" inside the main menu should exit the program and display the following
message: "Enjoy your day!"

* Test Result: SUCCESSFUL

These test cases are shown visually in the powerpoint slide deck that has been included
as a pdf in the 'T1A3_LiwaaHaddara' folder
