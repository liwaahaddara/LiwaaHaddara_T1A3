# **LiwaaHaddara_T1A3. My Terminal Application (A Library Book Managment System)**

## **Code Styling Conventions**

- I have used the Pascal case naming convention for any classes created in my source code (e.g:  
  `'Class LibraryBook():'`)
- I've used the snake case naming convention for any functions created in my source code (e.g:  
  `'def print_a_book():'`)
- The camel case naming convention has been used to name all files in the project (e.g:  
  ` libraryCatalogue.py`)
- Using Python to implement my code, I have chosen to use the mainstream pep-8 styling convention and, making sure all the code has been indented correctly
