This is a walkthrough of a demonstration of another feature in the Library program:

* We'll be testing the addition of a book into the catalogue

* After adding the book, we should be able to view it in the main catalogue

* When inside the main/navigation menu, input the number "2" to begin the process of adding a book



TEST CASE NUMBER ONE:
* Done on Sunday 17th July, 2022 around 7:15PM

* When adding a book, we'll enter an arbitrary book name, press enter, and then an arbitrary author name, and press enter

* The program should state that the book has been added

* Now back in the main menu, type "1" to view the new addition inside the catalogue

* Test Result: SUCCESSFUL


TEST CASE NUMBER TWO:
* Done on Sunday 17th July, 2022 around 7:20PM

* When adding a book, if a user doesn't provide BOTH a title and author name, the program should print a statement that asks the user to re-try the task, as the current entry will not be valid and thus not added to a catalogue

* This can be tested in one of three ways:
    1A. Enter "2" in main menu to begin adding a book
    1B. Do not type anything when asked for a title name
    1C. Type in an author name
    1D. The error message will pop up

    2A. Enter "2" in main menu to begin adding a book
    2B. Enter in a title name
    2C. Do not type in an author name
    2D. The error message will pop up

    3A. Enter "2" in main menu to begin adding a book
    3B. Do not add a title name
    3C. Do not add an author name
    3D. Error message will pop up

* Test Result: SUCCESSFUL

These test cases are shown visually in the powerpoint slide deck that has been included
