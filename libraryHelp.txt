OS Requirements:
Not much to speak about here. As long as you're using a current day Windows or Mac computer, you should be good to go!

Steps to install the terminal app:
1. Have Python installed on your computer
    * For macOS users, verify if this is the case by entering the following command into the
    'terminal' app:
    "python3 --version"

    * For windows users, type the following into the command line to verify if Python has been installed on your system:
    "python --version"

    If you see a version of Python 3 or greater, you should be fine

2. Have access to the terminal app project directory
    * The folder is named "T1A3_LiwaaHaddara"

    * Change the directory on your command line to this folder

3. Running the terminal app:
    * Enter the following into your command line to begin the program:
